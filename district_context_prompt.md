# District Context Prompt

**Version:** 1.1
**Purpose:** To describe the geographic, economic, and political character of a congressional district.

---

## Input Required

- District identifier (e.g., TX-28)
- Baseline file: `[district]_baseline.md`
- Census file: `[district]_census.md` (generated by `district_census_prompt.md`)

---

## Task

Provide factual context about the district's composition and character. This is background for understanding the political environment—not analysis of the current race.

**Note:** Demographic data (population, race/ethnicity, income, education, etc.) is covered in the separate census report. This prompt focuses on geography, economic drivers, political character, and key institutions.

## Output Format

### Output File Naming Convention

**REQUIRED:** Before generating output, load and apply all conventions from `district_naming_prompt.md`. This file governs output filenames, H1 headers, and YAML metadata blocks.

Output filename pattern: `[district]_context.md`
Example: `TX-28_context.md`

**CRITICAL: Document H1 header must match the filename (without `.md`):**
Example: `# TX-28_context`

**YAML metadata block (immediately after H1):**
```yaml
---
district: [district code]
type: context
date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
prompt: district_context_prompt.md
prompt_version: 1.1

1. **Local/regional news outlets** — Geographic and political culture context
2. **Bureau of Labor Statistics** — Economic data
3. **Academic sources** — For machine politics, historical patterns
4. **State/local government sources** — Geographic boundaries, major employers

**Note:** Demographic data sourcing is handled by the census prompt.

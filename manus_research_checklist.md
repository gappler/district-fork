## Known Problem Areas

Flag these explicitly if encountered:

- [ ] **Redistricting:** Is this a 2025 redistricted state? If yes, verify all data uses correct map.
- [ ] **Outdated PVI:** Cook PVI may not reflect 2025 redistricting yet. Note date of PVI.
- [ ] **Conflicting ratings:** If Cook/Sabato/Inside Elections differ, note all three.
- [ ] **Missing FEC data:** New candidates may not have filed yet. Note "No FEC filings as of [date]."
- [ ] **Name collisions:** Common names may return wrong person's records. Verify with district/state.

---

## Output Formatting

Each output file should include:

1. **Header:** District, date, prompt version used
2. **Sources section:** All sources cited with URLs and access dates
3. **Confidence flags:** Note any data points with LOW confidence
4. **Gaps:** Explicitly list what could not be found

## After Completion

- [ ] Cross-check key numbers against baseline file
- [ ] Flag any discrepancies between research and baseline
- [ ] Note any sources that were unavailable or paywalled
